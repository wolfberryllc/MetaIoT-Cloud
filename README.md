# MetaIoT is a sensor to Hyperledger and Blockchain storage project, that takes you from sensor to storage with AR visualization

## Phase 1 *Available now - Sensor to Data Visualization and Storage ✅



### This project (P1) helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (Apps) in augmented reality using Unity, Firebase and Google Cloud. 


P1.0 - Starter Project (Planter AI) + Unity 3D + Firebase + Google Cloud.

We've developed a sensor application (Python + Raspberry Pi + Arduino)

Stored the Python + Raspberry Pi data into Google Firebase through Python API's

Collected data from Firebase and displayed it in a Unity mobile application.

Displayed data on a static IP address from Firebase.

## Phase 2 Sensor to Hyperledger and Blockchain Storage with Visualization *Pending release :cyclone:
### This project (P2) helps developers prototype and publish sensor-driven (dApps) in augmented reality using Mobile Native, AWS, Hyperledger, and Cardano. 

P2.0 - Starter Project (Planter AI) + Mobile Native + AWS & Hyperledger + Blockchain Storage.

Phase 2.0  - In Development.

{Mobile dApp Development & Uploading to snapcraft.io, The App Store and Google Play using Augmented Reality (AR), AWS (Amazon Web Server & Services) & Hyperledger + Cardano} *Contact us for specifics using support@wolfberryllc.com - otherwise we will release all phase 2 assets, source code + notes around December 01 2022



 # Phase 3 (Management and Response System)
## This project updates the backend to use Azure to Hyperledger to blockchain storage. 
A Wallet management and response system for phase 2 will be completed in this new environment.
